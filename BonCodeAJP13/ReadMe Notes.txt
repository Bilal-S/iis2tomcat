==========================================

Version 0.9.1 Updates:
* Add: Added automated installer beta (all windows versions from XP on)
* Add: Added thread throttling to not overwhelm tomcat with request. Now allows forcing reconnect for every request if so desired
* Upd: Updated documentation with trouble shooting section

Version 0.9.2 Updates:
* Fix: Issues with UTF-8 conversion from double byte regions
* Fix: Forced Disconnect mode was not enabled when MaxConnections was set to zero, references to old connections would be maintained unnecessarily
* Add: Automatic release of all connection when settings file is changed 

Version 0.9.2.1 Updates:
* Fix: Change FlushThreshhold defaults to handle graphics pushed by script files better with IE, e.g. gif.cfm / png.cfm etc.


Version 0.9.2.2 Updates:
* Fix: gzip compression handling from servlets. Set correct content encoding.
* Fix: install on IIS7 did not write setting file
* Add: Updated troubleshooting information in Manuals 

Version 0.9.2.3 Updates:
* Fix: JSP response.sendRedirect() call uses HTTP 302 redirect. Would lead to timeout.
* Fix: Specific issues with Jetbrains TeamCity application implementation and protocol behavior (AJAX)
* Fix: Stop waiting on tomcat when redirect directive is given
* Fix: Handle Railo vs. tomcat native variances in File upload behavior with and without redirects.
* Inf: ISAPI redirector is not protocol compliant if packet size with form data is below max. bytes.
* Inf: ISAPI redirector is not protocol compliant when HTTP 302 redirect is issued and comm. is terminated by tomcat with END RESPONSE. Keeps sending data.


Version 0.9.2.4 Updates:
* Add: Installer update. Installation of .net framework feature as option for windows 7 and windows 2008+
* Add: User friendly error messages when we cannot connect to Apache Tomcat


Version 0.9.2.5 Updates:
* Fix: seperate AJP attributes from headers. All present optional http attributes are transferred even if not processed by tomcat.
* Fix: Recognize misordered packets from Tomcats (out of order GET BODY CHUNK) and provide propper response. This would result in blank screen.
* Add: add new setting to transfer optional header (x-tomcat-docroot) note capitalization
* Add: default secure connection redirect and session support via AJP (SSL); tomcat will automatically choose this mode and the connector will support it
* Add: automatically fix wrong content-length decleration if content is missing. Fill in empty characters where content is missing. This is not correct but will continue browser processing.
* Add: IP6 support
* Fix: Use of System Timer would leak memory when thread was destroyed
* Fix: AJP protocol header server and port designations send to servlet container were incorrect when IIS and tomcat were remoted.
* Add: HTTP header Blacklist and Whitelist options in settings file
* Fix: Correct flush protocol detection problem so HTTP flushes can be detected and spooled to browser.


Version 0.9.2.6 Updates:
* Fix: correct transfer of non-standard headers without the http prefix added by IIS
* Fix: compatibility with Axis1 projects
* Add: no longer force conversion of text to UTF8. Will pass directly content as is to browser from tomcat regardless of content-type declaration.
* Add: Setting [ForceSecureSession] to force secure session via SSL. Will automatically exchange secure session cookies and force all communication over SSL to the Webserver.
* Add: Settings for timeout tcp/ip connections are exposed and can be changed by user.

Version 0.9.2.7 Updates:
* Add: Improve http flush detection, add network stream behavior in addition to timer.
* Fix: Zero content tomcat packages would cause display of error message in browser.
* Fix: ignore binary transfers that contain AJP protocol magic markers would lead to empty screen.

Version 0.9.2.8 Updates :
* Fix: extend timeout for TCP socket so that longer timeouts in IIS Application Pool do not result in closed socket errors
* Add: automatic translation of client IPs to account for intermediaries (load balancers and proxies), e.g. HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR to REMOTE_ADDR automatic rewrite
* Add: assembly signing and strong name support so that library files can be deployed in Global Assembly Cache

Version 0.9.2.9 Updates:
* Add: setting to show suppressed headers (AllowEmptyHeaders). The connector skips headers that do not have data to speed processing. Set to true to send empty headers as well.
* Add: setting to send path info in alternate http header (PathInfoHeader). This is to bypass tomcat bug with AJP path-info transfer.
* Fix: Remove default for ResolveRemoteAddrFrom (HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR). Will now need to be explicitly set to be enabled.
